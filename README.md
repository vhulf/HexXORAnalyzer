A python-based utility for investigating a binaries HEX for "penguins" against any XOR (WIP)

```
python3 hex-xor-analyzer.py -f pathToFile.bin
```
----
{HEADER AND INITIAL INPUT IS SHOWN}
```
-> 00
```
{OUTPUT SHOWN IS SAME AS INPUT (XOR'd AGAINST HEX VALUE "00" )}
```
->> AA
```
{OUTPUT SHOWN IS INPUT XOR'd AGAINST HEX VALUE "AA"}
